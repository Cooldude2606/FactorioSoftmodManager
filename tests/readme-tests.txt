Note: 
these tests do not test any thing but can be used to make tests
this is because the jsons hold comments which provent the scripts from working
only use these to help make test files not used directly
some of these may be out of date; please see working examples for more info
/screnario/modules/module-control.lua will be the most upto date boiler print
