<h2 align="center">ExpGaming Factorio Softmod Manager Repository</h2>
<h5 align="center">(WIP)</h5>
<br>

Once finished this will be a command line interface for installing softmods onto factorio servers, all required dependies for the mod will be downloaded and added to the scenario and any optional one may also be installed once chosen by the user. A index server will be online that the client will use to find modules and the download links for each version, whole scenarios can be downloaded if there are setup using this system. 

Hopefuly we can make this a common feature that is easy to use but it is just a project im doing for the fun and better of the comunity so if nothing comes of it then oh well. Authenicate and a means to host your own modules will be needed and possibly the abilty to have multiple servers hosting different files. But first lets just get it working. 

Currently we have the commands: init, info, install and host. init allows the creation of the json files from the cli, info is a clean print of the jsons given extra info on module collections, install will be the main command once it is fully set up and host is currently just for testing but will allow a server to host the downloads.

If you read all that well done, just contant me (Cooldude2606) for further infomation if you want to help with the production of this extenstion, pull requests are also welcome.
